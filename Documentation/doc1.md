## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of our software (SimuWare) is to provide a virtual platform that enables users to assemble physical and electrical components in a 3D game-like environment and to simulate their interactions. SimuWare aims to provide an educational and prototyping tool for simulation enthusiasts, students, educators, and researchers.

### Scope
#### Goals
- SimuWare will feature a user-friendly interface for selecting, placing, and connecting components within a virtual environment.
- Users will also be able to simulate the behavior of assembled components.

#### Benefits
- Users will be able to simulate their prototypes without having to build them in real life.
- They will easily get to know the flaws in their circuits and will be able to correct those before building a real-life prototype.
