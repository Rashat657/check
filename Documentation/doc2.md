## Overall Description
### Product Perspective
This product aims to provide a rapid-prototyping environment for circuits and micro-controller based simulations. This will enable users to test their prototypes within our software without building them in real life. As a result, they will not have to do many hit-and-tries and waste their precious costly components.

#### User Interfaces
SimuWare is a desktop application (for windows).

#### Software Interfaces
- Unreal Engine / Unity 
- C++
- Arduino APIs

### Product Functions
#### 3D Environment
- SimuWare will provide a 3D virtual environment using Unreal Engine / Unity.
- Users will be able to navigate the environment using intuitive controls.

#### Part Assembly System
- Users shall be able to select from a library of Arduino components.
- Users shall be able to place selected components within the 3D environment.
- Components shall snap or attach to each other realistically when placed adjacent to each other.

#### Physics Simulation
- SimuWare will incorporate physics simulation to simulate interactions between assembled components.
- Components shall interact realistically with each other and the environment (e.g., gravity, collisions).

#### User Interface
- SinuGear shall provide a user-friendly interface for selecting, placing, and manipulating components.
- The interface shall allow users to access tools for assembly, simulation, and data visualization.

### User Characteristics
SimuWare aims to provide an educational and prototyping tool for simulation enthusiasts, students, educators, and researchers. Users can range from beginners to advanced users who like to tinker and create stuff using microcontrollers.

### Constraints
- The performance may vary on different hardwares depending upon factors like the presence of graphic card and RAM available.

### Assumptions and Dependencies
- The platform assumes some basic ideal-physics assumptions and some results might differ from real-world simulations.
- The user should have basic knowledge of arduino and familiarity with basic circuit design.
